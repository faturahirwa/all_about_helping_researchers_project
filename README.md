# All About Helping Researchers Project

A one-stop, modular toolkit designed to support researchers and students through every step of their workflow—from data collection and literature review to analysis, visualization, and reporting.

---

## Project Overview

This repository aims to provide a suite of independent but interoperable micro-packages and functions. Contributors can pick and choose the modules they need, or integrate them into a unified frontend dashboard:

* **Literature Discovery**: Automate keyword generation, search multiple academic databases, and filter by relevance and recency.
* **Data Collection & Management**: Modules for scraping, cleaning, and storing datasets in standardized formats.
* **Visualization Toolkit**: Intuitive graph and chart generators for exploratory data analysis.
* **AI Assistant Modules**:

  * **Proposal Writer**: Generate first drafts of research proposals or grant applications.
  * **Quick Insights**: Summarize articles, extract key points, and produce executive summaries.
  * **Reference Generator**: Create properly formatted bibliographies in APA, MLA, or custom styles.
* **Project Templates**: Boilerplate code and directory structures for common research types (e.g., clinical trials, social science surveys).
* **Reporting & Dashboard**: A potential frontend that unifies module outputs into interactive dashboards.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/all_about_helping_researchers_project.git
   cd all_about_helping_researchers_project
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   Each module lives in its own subfolder with its own `requirements.txt`. To install everything at once:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-all.txt
   ```
3. **Run Tests**
   Ensure each micro-package passes its unit tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Roadmap & To-Do List

### Core Modules

* [ ] **Keyword Generator**: Implement TF-IDF and word-embedding approaches for seed keywords.
* [ ] **Database Search Wrappers**: APIs for PubMed, arXiv, Google Scholar, and CrossRef.
* [ ] **Web Scraper**: Configurable scraper for journal websites with DOI extraction.
* [ ] **Data Cleaning**: Standardize CSV/JSON import, handle missing values and duplicates.

### Analysis & Visualization

* [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Automated summary statistics and correlation matrices.
* [ ] **Graph Generator**: Bar, line, scatter, and network graphs with minimal configuration.
* [ ] **Interactive Plots**: Exportable to HTML with tooltips (e.g., Plotly or Bokeh modules).

### AI & Insights

* [ ] **Article Summarizer**: Leverage LLMs to produce concise abstracts and highlights.
* [ ] **Proposal Drafting**: Templates for grant sections (Background, Methods, Budget).
* [ ] **Reference Formatter**: Support for APA, MLA, Chicago, Vancouver, and custom styles.

### Domain-Specific Extensions

* **Healthcare Research**:

  * [ ] Clinical trial registry lookup and summary.
  * [ ] Automated CONSORT diagram generator.
* **Social Sciences**:

  * [ ] Survey design wizard and question randomizer.
  * [ ] Sentiment analysis module for textual responses.

### Dashboard & Integration

* [ ] **Frontend Prototype**: React-based dashboard pulling data from module APIs.
* [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow users to enable/disable modules via configuration file.
* [ ] **Docker Deployment**: Containerize core services and dashboard for easy setup.
